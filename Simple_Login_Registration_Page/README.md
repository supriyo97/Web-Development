# LogIn/Reg Form

I'm creating a Registration and Login form with all the posible validation,styling using # HTML,# CSS,# PHP and # MYSQL(Database).

Here I'm using Email varification to activate the new users account.

This forms are will be protected from SQL injection attacks by hackers and also password would be encrypted by #Hashing algorithms & salt.

You can use this codes for your Login system which will be more secure than any other ordinary PHP coded Forms.
